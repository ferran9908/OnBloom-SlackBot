Demographic and Affinity Signals
signal.demographics.age: Influence by age group (e.g., 36_to_55).

signal.demographics.gender: Influence by gender (male, female).

signal.location: Influence by geolocation (WKT POINT, place Qloo ID, etc.).

signal.interests.entities: List of entity IDs serving as positive affinity signals.

signal.interests.tags: List of tag IDs serving as positive affinity signals.

Advanced Features
feature.explainability:

If true, response provides metadata on which signals contributed to results.

diversify.by / diversify.take (city-based diversification):

Return max N top-affinity entities per city.

bias.trends:

Weigh trending entities more heavily in results (off, low, medium, high).

Example Use Cases

1. Recommend Trending Artists in a City
   bash
   curl --request GET \
    --url 'https://staging.api.qloo.com/v2/insights?filter.type=urn%3Aentity%3Aartist&filter.geocode.name=London&bias.trends=high'
   --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'X-Api-Key: [YOUR_API_KEY]'
2. Filter by Demographics and Interests
   bash
   curl --request GET \
    --url 'https://staging.api.qloo.com/v2/insights?filter.type=urn%3Aentity%3Amovie&signal.demographics.gender=male&signal.demographics.age=36_to_55&signal.interests.tags=urn:tag:genre:media:horror'

   bash
   curl --request GET \
    --url 'https://staging.api.qloo.com/v2/insights?filter.type=urn%3Aentity%3Aplace&diversify.by=properties.geocode.city&diversify.take=5'
   --header 'accept: application/json' \
    --header 'X-Api-Key: [YOUR_API_KEY]'
   Handling Responses
   A successful response (200 OK) will return a JSON array of entities with associated affinity scores and metadata.
   Set feature.explainability=true to receive a breakdown of which signals were most influential in generating each recommendation.

Tips & Best Practices
Sandbox vs. Production: Use the correct API base URL. Hackathon and production keys are not interchangeable.

Exploring Parameters: The docs UI allows you to test and see real responses interactively.

Rate Limiting: Check documentation or contact support about API rate limits for your plan.

Debugging: Leverage the explainability feature for transparency in result generation.
